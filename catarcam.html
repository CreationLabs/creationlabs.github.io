<h3>Diagnosis of Cataract</h3>

<p>Cataract accounts for about 44% of visual impairments (36 million affected population) in India alone, accounting to an economic burden of $28B to the Indian GNP [1]. According to a World Bank study cited by the International Council of Ophthalmology, 85% of the men and 58% of the women who regained their sight returned to work, benefiting themselves and their families. In addition, the financial return on expense, in the year following surgery, was 1500%. It is further estimated that even if half of the Cataract blind were treated through surgery, at a one-time investment of $150M, the annual savings to the national GNP would be $1.1B,  a 7 – 8X annual return. The main reasons given for not availing of eye care services include non-affordability of eye care (37%), fear of the operation (31%, mostly among women), indifference to improvement and a resigned fatalistic attitude (32%), lack of escort to the hospital (19%), denial of surgery by doctor (13%), contraindications (10%) and ‘other priorities’ (8%) [2].
Projections show that among those aged 50+ years, the quantum of cataract surgery would double (3.38 million in 2001 to 7.63 million in 2020) and cataract surgical rate would increase from 24025/million 50+ in 2001 to 27817/million 50+ in 2020. Though the prevalence of cataract blindness would decrease, the absolute number of cataract blind would increase from 7.75 million in 2001 to 8.25 million in 2020 due to a substantial increase in the population above 50 years in India over this period.

    Leading Eye Care institutions lave undertook this mission like 
 LV Prasad Eye Institute, with an annual budget of US$3 million served over 18 million (1.8 crore) people with more than 50% services provided free of cost, regardless of complexity. 
Aravind Eye Care a non-profit organization, with an annual budget of US$ 19 million passed the 3.3 million mark for patients and delivered 380,000 surgical procedures this past year.
Sankara Nethralaya a  non-profit organization, with an annual budget of US$20 million has been leading the eye care demand all across the country and worldwide.
Support from Government of India, NPCB and WHO catering to vision 2020 has been relentless.<br>

According to the World Heath Organization “Approximately 90% of visually impaired people live in developing countries. About 65 % of all people who are visually impaired are aged 50 and older, while this age group comprises about 20 % of the world's population. With an increasing elderly population in many countries, more people will be at risk of visual impairment due to chronic eye diseases and ageing processes.”  CATARCAM
 is a powerful, portable imaging tool, to track & analyze the dissemination of nuclear sclerosis in Indian adults (opacification of the lens). We have embarked on this journey to understand the onset and opacification of the lens (in human eye) which was reported as a prime cause for reduction of vision in aging population and also leading to severe complications such as blindness. Over the course of this project we are determined to develop a prediction algorithm which could  quantitatively asses the reduction in vision and suggest a gestation period for surgical operation or suggest means to slow down the expanse of the affected area. We envision to put our work into practise by partnering with ophthalmologists and eye care centres across India, supporting our vision to deliver diagnostic eye care for  help us to improve the functionalities of the software.<br>

The idea was conceptualized and was judged to be one of the winners at "jugaad-a-thon", a healthcare hack-a-thon organized by CAMTech, MIT and Harvard Medical School.<br>
